# Twitter Clone Project

Welcome to the Twitter Clone project! This project is all about fun, experimentation, and learning. We're open to collaborations from anyone who's interested in contributing, and we encourage you to join us on this exciting journey.

## About

This project aims to replicate the core features of Twitter, providing a space for developers to explore and experiment with various technologies. While we're starting with a minimal set of features, our intention is to gradually evolve the project as we learn and grow. 

We're building this in our free time, purely for the joy of coding, and with an open mindset that welcomes anyone who wants to participate, learn, and collaborate with us.

## Stack

We've chosen the MENN stack for this project, which includes:

- **M**ongoDB: As our database system.
- **E**xpress.js: For building the backend server.
- **N**ext: For the frontend user interface.
- **N**ode.js: As the runtime environment for our server.

## Current Status

At the moment, we're in the early stages of development and are focusing on the basic functionality. As the project becomes more complex, we'll put dedicated efforts into writing proper documentation to help contributors understand and work with the codebase.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from developers of all levels of expertise. If you're interested in contributing, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone** the repository to your local environment.

3. Create a new **branch** for your work. Be descriptive in your branch name to indicate the feature or fix you're working on.

4. Make your changes, test them thoroughly, and ensure your code adheres to our coding standards.

5. Create a **pull request** to propose your changes. Be sure to explain the purpose of your changes and any relevant information.
